  # Should insert a key value pair into the hash table, where the key is the word and the value is a counter for the number of times the word appeared. When inserting a new word in the hash table, be sure to check if there is a Node with the same key in the table already.

  # 4️⃣ TODO: Complete the print_key_values method.

  # Traverse through the every Linked List in the table and print the key value pairs.

  # a: 1
  # again: 1
  # and: 1
  # blooms: 1
  # erase: 2
